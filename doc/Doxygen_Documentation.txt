##  NFsim Autogen Documentation with Doxygen
#####################################################
last updated 2015 by michael sneddon

NFsim was written to support automatic technical documentation using the
the freely available Doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).

To automatically generate documentation on NFsim, download and install
a copy of Doxygen from the above website, and from this doc directory
run the Doxygen program as:

>doxygen NF_docGenConfig



The NF_docGenConfig is the relavent configuration file that tells
Doxygen how to correctly parse the NFsim source code.  Note that to run
doxygen, you need to either provide the complete path to the Doxygen
executable, or add the Doxygen executable to your computer's Path.
Doxygen binaries are available for windows, linux, and mac, along
with source code, from the Doxygen website.
