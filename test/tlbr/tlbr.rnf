#  Example of a Run NF scripting file
#
#

#First, we can provide NFsim with any command line arguments that
#tell us how to run the simulation.  Any commandline arguments that
#NFsim normally accepts can be placed here

-utl 2   # set the universal traversal limit to 2, so that when complexes
         # form, we don't traverse the entire complex to extract out the products
-bscb    # block same complex binding (prevents all ring closure reactions, but
         # reduces performance)
-xml tlbr.xml  # the XML file that contains the model
-v
-dump [0.01:0.01:1;2:1:10;11:5:100;100:100:1000;1100:1000:10000]->dump/

#Key words include start, eq, sim, set, add, step, output, dump all, query, echo

#The 'begin' tag tells us to begin simulation and that
#all command line arguments have been declared
begin

  echo running tlbr
  #eq 50
  sim 1000 3
  print rxns
